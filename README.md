## How to Run

1. **Prerequisites**: Python 3.13+ (uses only standard library modules)

2. **Launch the application**:
   ```bash
   /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.13/bin/python3 home_calculator.py
   ```

3. **Using the Application**:
   - Fill in all the input fields with your specific financial data
   - Click "Generate Comparison" to see the analysis
   - Review the three tabs for detailed breakdowns

## Calculation Details

### Mortgage Calculations
- Uses standard amortization formula: `M = P * [r(1+r)^n] / [(1+r)^n - 1]`
- Where M = monthly payment, P = principal, r = monthly interest rate, n = number of payments
- Property tax calculated annually based on current home value
- Home value appreciation compounded annually

### Rent Calculations
- Monthly rent increased annually by the specified growth rate
- Compounded growth: `New Rent = Previous Rent * (1 + growth_rate/100)`

### Summary Analysis
- Compares total cost of ownership vs total rent paid
- Factors in home equity built and final home value
- Shows net financial position for both scenarios

## Example Scenario

Default values represent a typical scenario:
- $1,500,000 home with 20% down payment ($300,000)
- 5.75% APR on 30-year mortgage
- $4,300/month starting rent with 2.5% annual growth
- 3% annual home value growth
- $5,000 annual maintenance expense
- 6% brokerage cost + 2% registration expenses when selling
- 5% expected annual stock market returns
- 5-year comparison period

## Technical Notes

- Built with Python 3.13+ using tkinter for cross-platform compatibility
- No external dependencies required
- Responsive GUI with tabbed results interface
- Error handling for invalid inputs
- Professional styling and formatting

### Key Calculation Details
- **Mortgage Amortization**: Uses standard formula `M = P * [r(1+r)^n] / [(1+r)^n - 1]`
- **Stock Investment Gains**: `down_payment_value_gain + EMI_rent_investments_value_gain` (pure gains only, not total investment)
- **Capital Gains Tax on Stocks**: Applied to stock investment gains as an expense for rental option
- **Tax Deductions**: Mortgage interest only (up to $750k principal) - property tax not deductible
- **Capital Gains**: Tax benefit calculated as tax_slab √ó home_growth_value (when exemption enabled)
- **Annual Growth**: Applied to house prices, rent, and all other relevant metrics
